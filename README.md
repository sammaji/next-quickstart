## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, you'll need to clone this repository to your local system. Open your
terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samyabrata-maji/next-quickstart
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's directory using the cd command:

```bash
cd next-quickstart
```

Once you're inside the project directory, you need to install any dependencies
required for the project. Use your package manager of choice. For example, if
you're using Node.js and npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Configuration

Depending on the project, you may need to configure it before running it. Look
for a configuration file (eg. config.js, config.json, .env, etc.) in the
project directory or follow the configuration instructions provided in the
project's documentation.

## 4. Run the Project

Now that you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can
run the project. The exact command to start the project may vary depending on
the project's technology stack. Refer to the project's documentation or README
for specific instructions.

For example, if it's a Node.js application, you might start it with: 

```bash
npm start
```

Make sure to check the project's README or documentation for any additional
setup or configuration required to run the project successfully.

## 5. Access the Application

Once the project is running, open a web browser or use the appropriate client
application to access the project. By default, it may be available at
http://localhost:PORT, where PORT is the port number specified in the project's
configuration.

You should now have the project setup and running on your local machine.

refer to the project's documentation or seek help from the project's community
